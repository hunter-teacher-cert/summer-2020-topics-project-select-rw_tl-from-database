# Navigating a File System

# Lesson Overview
This lesson is intended to transition students from GUI (Graphical User Interface)
to CLI (command line interface), but can also be used to teach students
about file systems. Most apps these days, on phone or on PCs, hide
their file systems to be more user-friendly. But, knowledge here
is crucial in most higher-level CS projects. Teachers in those courses
are reporting that their students lack basic skills in this area.

I wrote this to be the first real content-heavy lesson of the
school year, for a senior elective in IT infrastructure & data
warehousing. It will be followed by lessons in Unix/Linux's
file system as part of a unit to introduce the bash shell and
the Linux operating system. MacOS is now built on a version of Unix,
which Linux takes most inspirations from, and even Windows now can
run Linux simultaneously through WSL & WSL2 besides having its own
Command Prompt & PowerShell.

Specifically, the lesson that follows will spend most of the time on
having students work concurrently on bashcrawl, a game that uses
real bash commands in a text adventure game. Students will be offered
extra credits to complete as much of the game as they can.

The third lesson of the unit will then formally introduce the Linux
file system and basic navigation commands. However, these later lessons
have not been written.

# Instructions
There is a slide deck for the lesson, which consists largely of
introducing vocabulary related to file systems. I also provide
two documents that I will assign on gClassroom. I place answer blocks
at the top of the documents to make grading easier. Less scrolling.

There is a Do Now that activates students' prior knowledge, and a Classwork
that asks them to apply what they learned from direct instruction.

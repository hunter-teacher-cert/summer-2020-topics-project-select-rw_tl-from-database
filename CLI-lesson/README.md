# Navigating a File System

# Lesson Overview
This lesson is intended to transition students from GUI
(Graphical User Interface) to CLI (command line interface), but
can also be used to teach students about file systems. Most apps
these days, on phone or on PCs, hide their file systems to be
more user-friendly. But, knowledge here is crucial in most
higher-level CS projects. Teachers in those courses are reporting
that their students lack basic skills needed to write complex programs.

I wrote this lesson to be the second content-heavy lesson of the
school year, for a senior elective in IT infrastructure & data
warehousing. This lesson will be preceded by a gamified intro to
command-line navigation using the games [Terminus]
(https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)
(for most students) and [bashcrawl]
(https://opensource.com/article/19/10/learn-bash-command-line-games)
(for experienced navigators). These text adventure games
teach real bash commands that players then use to play the games.

For most of the school year, my students will live on the Linux and
its bash command line. Even MacOS is now built on a version of Unix,
which Linux takes most inspirations from. Windows can now run the
Linux kernel simultaneously with Windows, through WSL & WSL2, besides
having its own Command Prompt & PowerShell.

The third lesson of the unit, immediately following this lesson, will
formally introduce various terminology around disks and partitions,
and reintroduce the Linux file system and basic navigation commands.
Those lessons have not been written.

# Instructions
Included is a slide deck for the lesson, which consists largely of
introducing vocabulary related to file systems.

I also provide two documents that I will assign on gClassroom. There is a
Do Now that activates students' prior knowledge, and a Classwork
that asks them to apply what they learned from direct instruction.

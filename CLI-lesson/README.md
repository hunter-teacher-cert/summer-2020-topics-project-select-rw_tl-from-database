# Instructions
This lesson is intended to transition students from GUI to CLI (command line interface).
It will be followed by a unit on both file system navigation and basic shell commands,
and later to shell scripting. This can be done on any OSes and shells,
but I will teach Linux and the bash shell.

There is a slide deck for the lesson, and two documents (which I assign on gClassroom).
I place answer blocks at the top of the documents to make grading easier. Less scrolling.
